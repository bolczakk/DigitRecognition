## Handwritten Digit Recognition AI
This is a simple AI project from scratch in C++ that recognizes handwritten digits. You provide an image with a digit (like 7), and the model will guess what it is. Great for learning about machine learning or building a fun side project.
## Structure of network
Simple neural network with one hidden layer (128 neurons).
## Libraries
I use SDL3 for graphical interface, making it easy to draw digits, visualize predictions in real time and eye-friendly.
## Instruction
You can train or load model from file by changing mode in main.cpp. To change input after running program press Space.
